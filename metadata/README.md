# metadata/

Metadata you write about the project and its data: the sample sheet (`samples.csv`), annotations, gene lists,
notes on sources. These are real files, not links, and the pipeline can read them like any input
(e.g. `tar_target(samples_file, "metadata/samples.csv", format = "file")`).
Everything here is committed, except files starting with `auto_`, which scripts generate (git-ignored).

## The data catalogue

| File | Made by | In git |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `auto_catalogue_data.tsv` | `scripts/sh/catalogue-data.sh`, from `data/` | no |
| `catalogue_data.tsv` | you, by reviewing the auto file and copying it | yes |

```bash
scripts/sh/catalogue-data.sh                                          # regenerate; reports new / changed / missing files
cp metadata/auto_catalogue_data.tsv metadata/catalogue_data.tsv    # accept it after review
```

The generated file starts from your reviewed copy: your descriptions (kind, sample, organism, tissue, ...)
and any columns you added are kept; file facts (path, format, size, owner, md5, ...) are refreshed; new
files are added; files no longer in `data/` are kept and marked `missing`. Describe new rows in
`catalogue_data.tsv`, then commit it.
